                    <p>The First Robotics Program is an American robotics competition that challenges teams of motivated individuals
                        to design and build a robot that meets specific criteria for a given game. Our team worked diligently to create
                        and implement an efficient robot and strategy.<br>
                        • Successfully implemented strategies derived from analyzing competing teams to maximize effectiveness, achieving a 3rd place finish among 60+ teams.<br>
                        • Contributed to coding the robot's claw mechanism and movement using Java. Self-taught Java through various online videos and tutorials to keep up with the project's demands.<br></p>
